Hi. 
My name is Zim and in a few short months I will be a Gerorge Washington University certified web developer. I work on the front and back end to give your team everything you need! This is one of my first projects as I hone in and develop new skills. {see what I did there? I not only develop web apps but also funny jokes ;) } 
When im not coding, I like to study medicne, help children with special needs and most of all play Futbol! If you like my work shoot me an email! You will find my information below.
